BRANCHING
---------
Adding a Branch
In GitHub, branches are a way of working on various versions of a single repository simultaneously.
By default, any single repository created is assigned a branch called MASTER and it is considered the final branch.
In GitHub, branches are useful in experimenting and editing of repositories before committing them to the master (Final branch).

Creating a branch off the master branch is the same as copying the master as it was at that instant.
Branches also prove useful in keeping bug fixes and feature work separated from the master branch.
After necessary changes, these branches are merged into the master branch.

To make a branch after creating the repository:
1. Go to your new repository by clicking on the repository name
2. Click on the “Branch-Master” button at the top to see a drop-down menu with a blank field for filling the branch name.
3. Enter the branch name
4. Press “Enter” or click on the blue “create- branch” box
5. By now two branches have been created; master and your new name branch
